dotfiles
============

Configuration files for Linux and the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL, aka Bash
on Windows). I also used to use Cygwin, so there may be some of that here too.
Feel free to reuse or suggest changes if some of the code seems odd.

- Use at your own risk, especially the installation scripts.
- I hate writing Bash, so any Bash scripts you see may be full of hacks and/or
  may have inconsistent style.
