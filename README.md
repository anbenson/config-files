dotfiles
============

Configuration files for Linux (and to some extent, Cygwin). Feel free to reuse
or suggest changes if some of the code seems odd.

- Use at your own risk, especially the installation scripts.
- I hate writing Bash, so any Bash scripts you see may be full of hacks and/or
  may have inconsistent style.
